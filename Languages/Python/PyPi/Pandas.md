# Basics
- pandas is a [Python](https://www.python.org/) package providing fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with “relational” or “labeled” data both easy and intuitive. It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for doing practical, **real-world** data analysis in Python. Additionally, it has the broader goal of becoming **the most powerful and flexible open source data analysis/manipulation tool available in any language**. It is already well on its way toward this goal.
## Installation
- run the following command
```bash
pip install pandas
```

- import pandas on the top of our file

```python
import pandas as pd
```
