# Basics

## HISTORY[](https://www.pygame.org/docs/tut/PygameIntro.html#history "Permalink to this headline")

Pygame started in the summer of 2000. Being a C programmer of many years, I discovered both Python and SDL at about the same time. You are already familiar with Python, which was at version 1.5.2. You may need an introduction to SDL, which is the Simple DirectMedia Layer. Created by Sam Lantinga, SDL is a cross-platform C library for controlling multimedia, comparable to DirectX. It has been used for hundreds of commercial and open source games. I was impressed at how clean and straightforward both projects were and it wasn't long before I realized mixing Python and SDL was an interesting proposal.

I discovered a small project already under-way with exactly the same idea, PySDL. Created by Mark Baker, PySDL was a straightforward implementation of SDL as a Python extension. The interface was cleaner than a generic SWIG wrapping, but I felt it forced a "C style" of code. The sudden death of PySDL prompted me to take on a new project of my own.

I wanted to put together a project that really took advantage of Python. My goal was to make it easy to do the simple things, and straightforward to do the difficult things. Pygame was started in October, 2000. Six months later pygame version 1.0 was released.
